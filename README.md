This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an incorrect way to check for undefined variables and its correct solution.  The script showcases the use of the 'eq' operator to compare against 'undef' which will always evaluate to false even when the variable is undefined.  The correct approach uses the 'defined' function which accurately determines if a variable holds a defined value.
